### Introduction
---
* This templated class moves what we've been doing, using a traditional procedural coding style, into a more modern OOD project.
### Instructions

* Once the `SigProLib` has been cloned, do this:
* `$ cd Templated_SignalStatisticsClass`
* `$ mkdir build -p && cd build`
* `$ cmake ..`
