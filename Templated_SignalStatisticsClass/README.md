## Templated Signal Statistics Class
---
### Introduction
---
* This templated class moves what we've been doing, using a traditional procedural coding style, into a more modern OOD project.
* However, this form of the software assumes that the signal can be an `int`, `double` etc; its much more likely the input signals will be saved as a `double` within a `.dat` file.
### Instructions
---
* Once the `SigProLib` has been cloned, do this:
* `$ cd Templated_SignalStatisticsClass`
* `$ mkdir build -p && cd build`
* `$ cmake ..`
* `$ cmake --build .`
* `$ ./main`
