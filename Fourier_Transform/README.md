## Fourier Transform
---
### Introduction
---
* The ___Fourier transform___ is a mathematical tool that takes a signal (a function of time, space, or another variable) and expresses it in terms of its __frequency content__.
    * In the __time domain__, a signal is described by how it changes over time.
    * In the __frequency domain__, the Fourier transform shows which frequencies are present in the signal and how strong they are.
* Essentially, it breaks down a complicated waveform into a __sum of simple sinusoids__ (__sines__ and __cosines__) of different __frequencies__, __amplitudes__, and __phases__.
* Key ideas:
    * It’s like taking a "recipe" of __frequencies__ that make up a signal.
    * __High frequencies__ correspond to __rapid changes__, while __low frequencies__ describe __slow variations__.
    * It’s widely used in physics, engineering, and data analysis—for example, in signal processing, image compression, quantum mechanics, and solving differential equations.

### Running the Application
