## Convolution Algorithm
---
### Introduction
---
* TODO.

### Basic Theory and Concepts
---
* TODO.
### Running the Software
* Once you have cloned the `SigProLib` do this:
* `$ cd ConvolutionAlgo`
* `$ mkdir build -p && cd build`
* `$ cmake ..`
* `$ cmake --build .`
* `$ ./main`

### Results
---
* The input signals `file1.dat` and `file2.dat` and output (`convoluted`) file, `ConvolutedSignal.dat` can be found in the `results` directory.
* A `Python` script can be found which plots the data.
* Note: a `png` image can also be found.
