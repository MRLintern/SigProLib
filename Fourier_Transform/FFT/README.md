## Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)
---
* This repository contains the software for implementing the ___Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)___.

### Results
---
* The `results` have been included for viewing.
* However, if you run the software you will generate these and they can be found in the `build` directory.
* TODO: the software will (probably) be altered so that the output files are sent to a separate appropriate directory.

### Plotting
---
* For plotting the results:
* Once the application has finished, `cd` into the `build` directory, where the output files are generated.
* Now run the script:
* `$ python3 plot.py`. The plot will be saved automatically in the `build` directory.
