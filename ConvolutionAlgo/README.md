## Convolution Algorithm
---
### Introduction
---
* TODO.

### Basic Theory and Concepts
---
* TODO.
### Running the Software
* Once you have cloned the `SigProLib` do this:
* `$ cd ConvolutionAlgo`
* `$ mkdir build -p && cd build`
* `$ cmake ..`
* `$ cmake --build .`
* `$ ./main`

### Results
---
* The results can be found in the `results` folder, called `ConvolutedSignal.dat`.
* You don't need this to run/use the software, but it gives you an example of what you should get.
* When you run the software, `ConvolutedSignal.dat` can be found in the `build` directory.
