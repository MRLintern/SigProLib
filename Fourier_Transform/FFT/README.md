## Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)
---
* This repository contains the software for implementing the ___Fast Fourier Transform (DFT)___.

### Results
---
* The `results` have been included for viewing.
* However, if you run the software you will generate these and they can be found in the `build` directory.
* TODO: the software will (probably) be altered so that the output files are sent to a separate appropriate directory.

### Plotting
---
* TODO: a `Python` script be provided soon allowing you to plot the output results.
